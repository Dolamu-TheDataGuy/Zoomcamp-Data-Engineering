# Week 1 - Infrastructure Setup
This week we would task revolves around the [New York Taxi dataset](https://d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net/trip-data/yellow_tripdata_2024-01.parquet). This dataset is a fact table containing details about taxi trips, such as trip length, amount, pickup and dropoff locations, dates, etc. Our goal is to set up an environment that allows us to ingest and store this data later for analysis.
